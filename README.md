# Torus

The Torus protocol introduces Torus Omnipools, which allocate liquidity in a single asset across multiple Curve pools, giving Torus liquidity providers (LPs) exposure to multiple Curve pools through a single LP token. All Curve LP tokens are automatically staked on Convex to earn CVX and CRV rewards. Additionally, Torus LPs receive TORUS, the ERC20 Torus DAO token. Liquidity in an Omnipool is allocated to Curve pools based on target allocation weights, which get updated regularly through a liquidity allocation vote held by the vote-locked TORUS holders.

For a more detailed overview of the protocol please refer to [the whitepaper](https://torus.finance/whitepaper.pdf) and [the documentation](https://docs.torus.finance/torus-finance/)
